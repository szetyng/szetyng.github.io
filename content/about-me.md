I am an electrical and electronic engineering graduate from Imperial College London. Throughout my four years in university, I have developed a keen interest in software development. One of my fondest collaborations from my time in Imperial was a project with Microsoft to build a Visual Studio Code extension geared towards data scientists. It provided notebook-like functionalities within the code editor itself, and has since been [integrated with Microsoft's official Python extension](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/data-science-with-python-in-visual-studio-code/) as part of its data science features!

I am now a software developer in Gamuda Engineering, where I am part of the R&D Tunnel team. We have been developing numerous software solutions to improve tunnelling productivity; among them is a cloud-based data visualisation web app built using Python FastAPI, Vue.js and Firebase, running on Google Cloud Platform.

Some of my interests include contemporary musicals, reading, history and coffee. In my free time nowadays, I like experimenting with filter coffee. I started brewing my own coffee in my fourth year of uni, having decided that I've been spending too much money on flat whites from the library cafe! My first brewer was an Aeropress, but I very quickly got myself a V60 dripper and after a couple of years, I am now a proud owner of a French press. 

I also like to write. I have been keeping a journal since my first year of university, and I took a creative writing class back in 2018. Writing is not something that I do often anymore, but I would like to get it started again so I am challenging myself to write by adding a [blog](/blog) section to my website. 

As software developers, our careers truly involve lifelong learning as new technologies keep coming into play every year. Sometimes it's not even about new technologies, but old, time-tested fundamentals that are new to us either because we have just stumbled upon them or their importance has recently become known to us. Either way, whatever it is that I'm learning, I am going to write about it in my blog - partly for me, since writing things down helps me better understand the material, and partly for whoever is going to encounter the same topic in the future.

Anyway, that's enough about me for now! Feel free to contact me at [lee.szetyng@gmail.com](mailto:lee.szetyng@gmail.com) if you would like to take a look at my CV.
