# Hello
Hello there, the angel from my nightmare, the shadow in the background of the morgue.
The unsuspecting valley of the darkness in the shadow omg 
I've forgotten the lyrics

I have a mechanical keyboard and I'm kinda playing around with the RGB backlight right now
and I've got it set on a weird setting where the light only lights up when you tap on the key.
Starting to realise that I might actually be able to touch type. 

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Ok i kinda know where the keys roughly are in the keyboard but
I dont know the layout for sure and it leads to a lot of typos so im going to use a different backlight setting
